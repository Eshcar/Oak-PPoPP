Efficient ordered in-memory key-value (KV-)maps are paramount for the scalability of modern data platforms. In managed  
languages like Java, KV-maps face unique challenges due to the high overhead of garbage collection (GC).

We present \oak, a scalable concurrent KV-map for environments with managed memory. \oak\/ offloads data from the managed 
 heap, thereby reducing GC overheads and improving memory utilization.
An important consideration in this context is the programming model since a standard object-based API 
entails moving data between the on- and off-heap spaces. 
In order to avoid the cost associated with such movement, we introduce a novel {\em zero-copy\/} (ZC) API.

We have released an open-source Java version of \oak. 
We further present a prototype \oak-based implementation of the internal multidimensional index in Apache Druid.

Our experiments show that Oak is often 2x faster than Java's state-of-the-art concurrent skiplist.
