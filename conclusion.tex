We presented \oak\/ -- a concurrent ordered KV-map for memory-managed programming platforms like Java. 
%\oak\ is optimized for the real-time big data systems. 
\oak\/ features off-heap memory allocation and GC, in-situ atomic data processing, zero copy API, and internal organization for high speed data access. 
It implements an intricate efficient concurrent algorithm. %, formally proven  correct in the supplementary material.
Multiple benchmarks demonstrate \oak's advantages in scalability and resource efficiency versus the state-of-the-art. 
\oak's code is production quality and open sourced. Its prototype integration with Apache Druid (incubating) demonstrates decisive 
performance gains.
